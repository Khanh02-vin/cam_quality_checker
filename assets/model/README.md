# TFLite Model for Orange Quality Detection

This directory should contain your trained TensorFlow Lite model for orange quality assessment.

## Expected files:
- `orange_quality_model.tflite` - The TensorFlow Lite model
- `labels.txt` - The labels for classification results

## Note:
For the application to work properly, you will need to train and convert a suitable image classification model to TFLite format and place it in this directory.
